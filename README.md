# Solarpower-Management
MERN Fullstack project

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently under development.

SolarPower Management is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack, designed to monitor and manage solar energy units and their energy production records. The application allows users to track solar unit performance, view energy generation statistics, and manage related data efficiently.

## Overview
The application consists of:
- A **React frontend** to visualize solar energy data and user interactions.
- A **Node.js/Express backend** that exposes RESTful APIs for managing solar units, energy generation records, and user authentication.
- **MongoDB** as the database to store users, solar units, and energy generation records.
- **JWT authentication** for secure user login and session management.

The project is still under active development, so some features may not be fully implemented yet.

## Features (Planned)
- User registration and authentication
- CRUD operations for solar units
- Logging and visualization of energy production records
- Role-based access (admin vs. user)
- Responsive dashboard and data analytics
